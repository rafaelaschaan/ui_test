<h1>Jovanny Lemonad Standard License Agreement</h1><p>By selecting the &#8220;Accept License Agreement&#8221; button, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this <br>
Agreement. This Agreement, in conjunction with the receipt that accompanies each purchase from <br>
MyFonts.com (&#8220;MyFonts&#8221;), constitutes the complete agreement between you and MyFonts.</p>
<p>1. Allowed uses</p>
<p>You may use the licensed fonts to create images on any surface such as computer screens, paper, web <br>
pages, photographs, movie credits, printed material, T-shirts, and other surfaces where the image is a <br>
fixed size.</p>
<p>You may use the licensed fonts to create EPS files or other scalable drawings provided that such files <br>
are only used by the household or company licensing the font.</p>
<p>2. Number of users</p>
<p>The maximum number of simultaneous users is specified in the applicable receipt. All users must <br>
belong to the same company or household purchasing the font.</p>
<p>3. Third parties</p>
<p>You may provide the font to a graphic designer, printer or other service bureau that is working on your <br>
behalf only if they agree to use the font exclusively for your work, agree to the terms of this license, <br>
and retain no copies of the font on completion of the work.</p>
<p>You may not provide the font or make it accessible to any other third parties.</p>
<p>4. Embedding</p>
<p>You may embed the licensed fonts into any document you send to third parties. Such documents may <br>
be viewed and printed (but not edited) by the recipients.</p>
<p>You may not under any circumstances embed the licensed fonts into software or hardware products in <br>
which the fonts will be used by the purchasers of such products. Such use requires a different license <br>
which may be offered by the Foundry through MyFonts. Please contact help@myfonts.com for further <br>
information.</p>
<p>5. Modifications</p>
<p>You may import characters from the font as graphical objects into a drawing program and modify such <br>
graphical objects.</p>
<p>You may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative <br>
works based on the licensed font itself without Foundry&#8217;s prior written consent. </p>
<p>6. Copyright </p>
<p>The font and the accompanying materials are copyrighted and contain proprietary information and <br>
trade secrets belonging to the foundry owning the font. Unauthorized copying of the Product even if <br>

that is caused or encouraged by your failure to abide by the terms of this Agreement. </p>
<p>7. Termination </p>
